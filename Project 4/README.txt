Project 4 Handin
Alex Sun Yoo (ayoo), Michael Nye (mnye), Ozan Iskilili (oiskilib)

Our handin is organized with the following subdirectires:

    /images/
        The test images provided to us for the assignment

    /Mito_GFP_a01/
        The test image series provided to us for the assignment

    /report/
        The tex file, PDF, and figures for our report

    /results/
        This contains our script outputs; these include segmented images, as
        well as AVI files generated from our image sequences. It is broken
        down by section numbers, and then by the algorithm used to generate
        the data.

    /src/
        All of our MATLAB code is in this directory, as well as all included
        code from other sources. The MEX files in the handin were compiled for
        Mac OSX, and exist just as a sample of our directory structure;
        running this code elsewhere may require recompiling some code.
